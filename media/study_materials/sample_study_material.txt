Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.
Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other. These include:
- Machine learning (ML)
- Robotics
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Computer vision
- Expert systems
- Neural networks

One of the goals of AI is to create systems that can solve complex problems in a human-like manner, such as recognizing speech, understanding language, and making decisions.
