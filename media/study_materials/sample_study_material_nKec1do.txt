Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
AI is based on the idea that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the simplest to those that are more complex.
